# Dual_Domain_Learning

## Abstract

## Model

The architecture of our network, which consists of two main modules: 
  
the ***Amplitude Correction Module (ACM)*** and the ***Phase Correction Module (PCM)***.
  
Specifically, the ***ACM*** restores the amplitude spectrum of degraded images to remove JPEG artifacts, and the ***PCM*** restores the phase spectrum information to refine the highfrequency information.
